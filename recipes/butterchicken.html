        <h3>You are not a <em>Chicken Lover</em> unless you try this out</h3>
        <p>Butter Chicken, also known as murg makhani, is an Indian curry dish made of chicken that’s coated in a well seasoned tomato gravy that includes butter and cream.</p>
        <p>Chicken is marinated in yogurt, spices, garlic and ginger, then later cooked in a tandoor, but it can also be pan fried, grilled or oven roasted. After that it is tossed with the simmered, richly seasoned tomato sauce.

            This butter chicken recipe is easy and straightforward. It just involves a bit of extra time. It’s one of those hard to mess up dishes as long as you follow a few simple directions and tips.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken thigh</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Whole plain yogurt</strong>: I use regular yogurt though Greek yogurt would be fine as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Lemon juice</strong>: Use freshly squeezed juice for better flavor. In a pinch lime juice will work great too.</li>
            <li><strong>Garam masala</strong>: I highly, highly recommend homemade Garam Masala </li>
            <li><strong>Fenugreek leaves</strong>: This is an ingredient most grocery stores don’t carry in the U.S. but it’s a staple for this dish. If you’ve never cooked with it you’ll quickly realize this is what your Indian recipes may have been missing all along. You can purchase it online</li>
            <li><strong>Turmeric</strong>: A classic spice in Indian cooking. It adds that yellow color and unique flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Smoked paprika</strong>: It is all about building flavor in this dish and the hint of smokiness here does just that.</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Only use fresh garlic here.</li>
            <li><strong>Ginger</strong>: Only use fresh ginger as well.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong>: Season to desired preference. If you’d like you can mix up the marinade, taste it for seasoning, then after add the chicken.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter</strong>: An absolute staple ingredient. It brings that classic buttery goodness here.</li>
            <li><strong>Yellow onion</strong>: Onion is essential to really build up the overall flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Cayenne pepper</strong>: A spice that brings that spicy element.</li>
            <li><strong>Canned fire roasted tomatoes</strong>: That hint of char from fire roasting gives the sauce that extra something.</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy cream</strong>: We are going for a rich sauce so the recipe includes both butter and cream!</li>
            <li><strong>Chicken broth</strong>: This isn’t always typical in butter chicken but I think the sauce is a little too thick without it here so only a little is needed for thinning.</li>
            <li><strong>Cilantro</strong>: The perfect finishing touch for both freshness and color contrast.</li>
